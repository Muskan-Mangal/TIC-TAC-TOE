# TIC-TAC-TOE
With the help of this little program learning how to use GIT :)

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game written in Python3. No specific algorithm is used. Just 
simple storage and display of user input data at specific user input position. 

It contains:
1) tictactoe.py -- Conatins the main code which we r going to run on our terminal if we want to play.
2) Readme.md -- To guide you about how the project works.
3) image folder : contain some images of the program running on terminal

## How to Run the code and play the game in ur PC:
First download the code and extract it or clone it with git (using `git clone <url>`). Then move to the directory
having the code (using `cd <path>`). Then run the file using `python3 tictactoe.py`. You will see something like this

## How to contribute to the code
In order to contribute to the code, you have to first fork this repository
on Github. Then clone the repository from your own account (install git and
run `git clone <url>`). Then create a new branch in git, make changes to the
code and commit your changes after testing them. Once a new feature has been
